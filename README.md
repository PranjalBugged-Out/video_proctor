## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Project Name: [Video Proctoring Analysis ]  
Team Members:  
- [Pranjal Babel]  
- [Pratik Raj]  


Our project aims to [The AI-Powered Video Proctoring System aims to revolutionize remote exam monitoring by providing a secure, scalable, and automated solution for educational institutions, hiring agencies, and certification bodies. Leveraging computer vision, AI-driven facial recognition, gaze tracking, object detection, and audio analysis, the system identifies cheating behaviors, unauthorized assistance, and suspicious activities in real-time. By minimizing human intervention, reducing false positives, and ensuring privacy-compliant monitoring, it enhances the integrity, accuracy, and fairness of online assessments while making them cost-effective and widely accessible. ].
